[b]This mod brings back the Cracked Crown item from the full version of Alchemist NPC.
This mod does not require AlchemistNPC Lite but its a very nice mod and you should use it.[/b]

The Cracked Crown is a pet item which has a very low chance (1 out of 33333 by default) of dropping from any enemys and NPC.
The Cracked Crown summons, Snatcher, the cursed prince, Snatcher offers stats in turn for souls of the ememies you kill.

[b]For the future, if I ever do this that would be cool:[/b]
 - Cat Scratch animation for Very Soft Blanket
 - Docter Fee (CalamityMod adds its own)
 - Sunkrova ammo
 - Autoinjector(s)
 - Uganda boss and boss drops (this is a very large task)

 [b]The mod currently adds:[/b]
 -Cracked Crown
 -Cracked Crown Skin
 -Counter Matter
 -World Warper and its Modified counterpart
 -Simulation Control Unit
 -Bustling Fungus (not from alchemistnpc)
